# Deployment Options for Maccabi Haifa Calendar Sync

This guide covers different ways to run the automated sync, from local Mac to cloud servers.

## üñ•Ô∏è Option 1: Local Mac (Current Setup)

### Requirements
- ‚úÖ **Your Mac must be running** for the sync to work
- ‚úÖ **No manual triggering** needed once set up
- ‚úÖ **Cron triggers** the job automatically
- ‚úÖ **Customizable frequency**

### Setup Commands

**Daily sync (recommended):**
```bash
./sync_maccabi.sh setup daily        # 9:00 AM every day
```

**Other frequencies:**
```bash
./sync_maccabi.sh setup hourly       # Every hour
./sync_maccabi.sh setup twice-daily  # 9:00 AM and 9:00 PM
./sync_maccabi.sh setup weekly       # Mondays at 9:00 AM
```

### Pros & Cons
‚úÖ **Pros**: Simple setup, no additional costs, full control
‚ùå **Cons**: Mac must stay on, stops when Mac sleeps/shuts down

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Option 2: Cloud Server (Always Running)

### 2A. GitHub Actions (Free, Recommended)

**Pros**: Free, no server maintenance, always running
**Cons**: Requires some GitHub setup

**Setup Steps:**
1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Add `credentials.json` as a GitHub Secret
3. Create GitHub Actions workflow

**Example workflow file** (`.github/workflows/sync.yml`):
```yaml
name: Maccabi Haifa Calendar Sync
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * *'  # Daily at 9:00 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch:     # Manual trigger

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.x'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install requests beautifulsoup4 google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-api-python-client pytz
    - name: Setup credentials
      run: echo '${{ secrets.GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS }}' > credentials.json
    - name: Run sync
      run: python3 auto_sync.py
```

### 2B. Raspberry Pi (Low-cost home server)

**Pros**: Always on, low power, one-time cost (~$50)
**Cons**: Initial hardware setup

**Setup Steps:**
1. Install Raspberry Pi OS
2. Copy your sync files to Pi
3. Set up cron job like on Mac
4. Runs 24/7 in your home

### 2C. Cloud VPS (DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.)

**Pros**: Professional, always on, reliable
**Cons**: Monthly cost (~$5-20/month)

**Setup Steps:**
1. Create small cloud server
2. Install Python and dependencies
3. Copy sync files and credentials
4. Set up cron job

### 3B. Wake Mac for Sync (macOS)
```bash
# Schedule wake-up before sync
sudo pmset repeat wakeorpoweron MTWRFSU 08:55:00
```

### 3C. Menu Bar App (Keep Mac Awake)
- Use apps like "Amphetamine" or "Caffeine"
- Keep Mac awake during work hours

## ü§ñ Option 4: Mobile/Always-On Solutions

### 4A. Termux (Android)
Run Python scripts on Android phone:
1. Install Termux app
2. Install Python and dependencies
3. Set up sync script
4. Use cron-like scheduling

### 4B. iSH (iOS)
Limited but possible on jailbroken iOS devices

## üõ†Ô∏è Current Status Check

See what's currently set up:
```bash
./sync_maccabi.sh status       # Check last sync
crontab -l                     # View current cron jobs
./sync_maccabi.sh logs         # See recent activity
```

## üóëÔ∏è Remove Automation

To stop automatic syncing:
```bash
crontab -e                     # Edit cron jobs
